Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Egineering is a systematic application of egineering principle, methods and tools for development and maintaince of softwares with high-quality. Software egineering plays an important and crucial role in the technology industry in that it enables the creation of sotfware applications and systems that powers and gives value to modern life in areas e.g Communication, Precision Agriculture, Health and so on

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

In response to the growing complexity of software system and the need for a structured development methodologies, there has been a milestones in the evolution of software engineering. such milestones includes 
1. the development of programming languages such as fontran and C.
2.  the adoption of software engineering as a majored course in the 60s.
3.  the advent of structured programming in the 70s 
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software Development Life Cycle
1. Requirements; gathering and documenting the user needs and product requirement
2. Design: this is process of designing the user interface 
3. testing: testing is done to acertain that the product meets high-quality standard, identifies and fix defects and finally meets functional rquirements.
4. implementation: is the actually development of product by writing codes
5. Deployement: this is the when the finished product is sent out
6. Maintenace: deals with updates and other services

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies is a sequential appraoch to development with distinct phases  
While Agile methodologies is an iterative and incremental appraoch to development that is focused on flexibility and responding to changes
Examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate
Water methodogies is suitable for suituation where research and development R&D is hihgly needed
while Agile methodologies is appropriate for gathering actionable- feedback from the end users

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: a software Developer sees to the actual development of software products and sysytems
Quality Assurance Engineer: Designs and excutes test plans that ensures thta the software product is of high quality and meets funtional requirements.
Project Manager: takes charge of the development process to ensure seamless development processs and meeting deadlines 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is a software suite that provides a total package for coding, debugging and testing codes
e.g Virtual Studio, eclipes and Intellij IDEA
Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process is essential for tracking source code and coordinating collaboration with team members
e.g Git and subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Requiremenent changes
2.Technical debt
Strategies to overcome these challenges are !. effective communication and adopting Agile methodoligies

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing, is the testing individual components or modules 
integration testing is the testing of interaction between components and subsystems of the product
system testing is the complete testing of the software product 
and acceptance testing is the testing against usser needs and functional requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the crafting of statements and instruction to get optimal feedback from an AI models

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"find Dog Breeds"
Improved: "Find small dog breeds that are compatiable with families with little kids, living in a city."
